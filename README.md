# #] PRIZ.md
A "server-side" processor for my markdown flavor

*it processes on whichever device calls it

[View the syntax](https://voxelprismatic.github.io/priz.md/view), it is different than regular
MarkDown in more ways than one.

[Test it here](https://voxelprismatic.github.io/priz.md/markup)

## #] How to use it
Add `<script type="text/javascript src="https://voxelprismatic.github.io/priz.md/markup.js" id="priz_script"></script>`
to the `<head>` of your page.

To use the markdown, just do the following:
```js
var content = `
<content>
`;

elementNode.innerHTML = mark_page(content); // Actually parse the markdown
sub_styles(); // Updates things like dicts and tables and accents
```

## #] Important notices
1. This also adds the proper CSS style sheet to your page. If you don't like this, you can
override it by putting your CSS style sheets after the script. However, there are a bunch
of styles [at least 100]. The most important ones can be seen below.

2. There are more functions and variables, so if you don't want to live with that use
`iframe.js` instead of `markup.js`. You'll still use `mark_page(content)`, but you'll
need to `await` it first.

3. When adding something to the code directly, do NOT edit `out/md.min.js`, that file is
automatically generated by `min.py`, so it is easy to create. All files are in the `md` folder,
so edit those files instead if you want to.

4. Don't only add `md.min.js` to your site unless you've redefined the following styles. 
If you don't want to recreate those, then use `markup.lite.js` or `iframe.lite.js`

| Style | Purpose |
| - | - |
| `.btn` | A button that isn't |
| `.hide` | A spoiler |
| `.unhide` | Unspoils `.hide` |
| `.code` | A code block |
| `.dict` | Just a line between a key and a value |
| `.line` | A section seperator |
| `.def` | Not that important but is useful for accessibility |

## #] Features / bug fixes
You can always ask for new features or bring light on bug fixes in the issues tab.
If it is a feature request, just be sure that you upload a picture of what the style should
look like, unless it is fairly obvious.
